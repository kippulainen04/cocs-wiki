## üöÄ Overview
CoCs is a cloned React web application inspired by the idea of the famouse mobile game Class of Clans in Finland. With the help of `create¬¥react-app`, ReactJs provides a ready-built template to implement coding on top of it, so we do not have to configure Babel and Webpack by ourselves. Also, the advantage of ReactJs lies in the power of taking care our virtual DOM, in which we do not have to contact with the DOM manually as Vanilla Javascript.  

   >*Core philosophy of React is composing applications from many specialised reusable components.*

In this project, besides **[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#:~:text=The%20HyperText%20Markup%20Language%20or,(HyperText%20Markup%20Language)), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) and [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)**, **ReactJs**, a Javascript library is used to build and advance user interfaces based on divided UI components. [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript), a superset of Javascript is implemented to allow us to detect errors early and avoid some runtime erros.  Additionally, **[Progressive Web Application](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)** is applied to help us measuring the quality of the web app.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Learning Objectives

After fulfilling the project, I acquire knowledge to:
* Build and style somewhat dynamic webpages with semantic **HTML** and **CSS** and **Javascript** with **ReactJs** library on top
* Implement best practices and standards when structuring HTML files using nested elements, indentation, comments, and line breaks
* Implement the use of ReactJs for DOM manipulation and minify the files of our project with the help of Webpack from `create-react-app`
* Implement the use of **Material UI and styled-component** and **Google font**, to advance the styling of the project and implement **Google's Material Design** concept
* Implement **CSS** styling via class, id and element selectors using external stylesheets and inline/nesting styles to make 3D effect for characters
* Implement the use of `.jsx` extension to build reuseable component for user interfact, along with `React hooks`
* Implement the use of **Fetch API**, along with `async/await` to retrieve data from `JSON` file
* Implement the use of **TypeScript** to detec erros of types during development
* Perform common commands via the command line to interface with the operating system, such as navigating the file tree and creating, opening and comitting the file and directory to github
* Use **Git workflow** to initialize projects, track changes, and host via remote server
* Execute live deployment using **GitHub** Pages
